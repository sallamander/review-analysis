# Review-Analysis 

This repository focuses on using food review text from [Amazon reviews](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html) to try to predict whether or not a given review was helpful. Head to the `review_analysis/viz` folder to take a look at data set statistics as well as word visualizations, and check out the `review_analysis/models` folder to see what was learned from the text. 

## Current Status/Next Steps

This repository showcases a week-long coding challenge that I received as a take-home interview. I like the idea of keeping this encapsulated in the one week time frame I was given, and as such will not be taking any next steps.
