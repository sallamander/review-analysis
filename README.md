# Review-Analysis 

This repository focuses on using food review text from [Amazon reviews](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html) to try to predict whether or not a given review was helpful. Head to the `review_analysis/viz` folder to take a look at data set statistics as well as word visualizations, and check out the `review_analysis/models` folder to see what was learned from the text.
